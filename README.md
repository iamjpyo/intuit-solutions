# ITS Front End DEV Test

Welcome to the IntuitSolutions front-end development test!

During this coding test, your interviewer(s) will be checking in with you every half hour to make sure you're not stuck. If at any point during the testing process you have a question or feel that you need to talk through your code, please don't hesitate to reach out. This test is not only to get a better understanding of your skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but it's also to see how well you communicate and think about the problems you're trying to solve. If you don't have any questions during the test, that's fine too. Breezing through the test won't be held against you!

Amount of time to complete the test: 2h 30m

The steps you should take to complete this task:

1. Replicate the design supplied using HTML and CSS.

   - Do your best to make it look exactly like the design
   - Your code should be clean and readable
   - Feel free to use Google anytime you need it!
   - Don't use a pre-made grid system or components (e.g. no Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.)
   - Don't worry about making the site responsive (mobile)

2. If you are able to finish the HTML and CSS before the allotted time is up, feel free to try the javascript challenge!

   - This part is completely optional. It won't be any points off or held against you if you don't complete it.
   - If you're more comfortable writing with JQuery, feel free to import it.

   Optional JS:

   - Make the search field open an alert message on submit. The alert message should be the text that is in search field.
   - Make the tabs (First Tab, Second Tab, etc) functional so the containter below them renders different content for each tab.

If you finish before the allotted time, please reach out to your interviewer(s).

Important Note About Codesandbox Images:

Codesandbox has an odd quirk where you need to re-upload images in order to reference them in your code. You can do this by opening them in the file viewer, saving them to your machine, and dragging & dropping that image back into Codesandbox `images` folder. Make sure to remove the duplicate images.
